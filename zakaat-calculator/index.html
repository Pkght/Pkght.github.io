        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>What is Zakat?</h2>
            <p>Zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam, is an obligatory act of charity that requires Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth to donate a certain portion of their wealth, typically 2.5%, to eligible recipients. It is a spiritual and social duty that purifies the wealth of the giver and provides for the needs of the poor and destitute.</p>
            <p>This calculator is designed to help you determine the amount of Zakat you owe based on your total assets and liabilities.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Understanding the Nisab Threshold</h2>
            <p>The Nisab is the minimum amount of wealth a Muslim must own before they are obligated to pay Zakat. If your total net worth is below the Nisab threshold, you are not required to pay Zakat. The Nisab can be calculated based on the current market value of either gold or silver.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gold Standard:</strong> The Nisab is the equivalent of 87.48 grams of gold.</li>
                <li><strong>Silver Standard:</strong> The Nisab is the equivalent of 612.36 grams of silver.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This calculator uses the silver standard, which is often recommended by scholars as it results in a lower threshold, thus allowing for a greater distribution of wealth to the needy.</p>
