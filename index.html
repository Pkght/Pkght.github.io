                <h1>Welcome to Quicknisab</h1>

                <p>
                    Quicknisab is created to help Muslims carry out their religious duties with clarity,
                    accuracy, and confidence. Many essential Islamic acts, such as calculating Zakat, determining
                    the Nisab threshold, or distributing inheritance, require correct knowledge and careful
                    calculations. This website provides a collection of easy-to-use online tools that simplify
                    these responsibilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our goal is to serve as a reliable companion for Muslims around the world. Each tool is
                    designed to follow authentic Islamic guidelines, and our explanations are written in simple,
                    clear language so that anyone can understand them. Whether you are looking to calculate your
                    yearly Zakat, check the current Nisab value, understand inheritance shares, or explore other
                    aspects of Islamic teachings, you will find useful tools and helpful information here.

                    short descriptions and guidance to help you understand how and why specific calculations are
                    made. As the website grows, we will continue adding more tools, articles, and educational

                <p>
                    Each tool on this website is developed after studying authentic Islamic guidelines from
                    reliable scholars and sources. While our calculators and guides are designed to give accurate
                    results, every individual situation can be different. For complex or personal matters, we
                    always recommend consulting a knowledgeable Islamic scholar.
