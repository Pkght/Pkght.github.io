                    <h2>What is Islamic Inheritance?</h2>
                    <p>Islamic inheritance, also known as 'Mirath' or 'Fara'id', is the distribution of a deceased
                        Muslim's property and assets to their heirs in accordance with the principles of Islamic law.
                        The rules of inheritance are specified in the Quran and are designed to ensure a just and
                        equitable distribution of wealth among family members.</p>
                    <p>This calculator provides a simplified calculation based on the most common scenarios. For complex
                        cases, it is highly recommended to consult a qualified Islamic scholar.</p>

                    <p>The Quran specifies fixed shares for certain primary heirs. Here are some of the key heirs and
                        their prescribed shares:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Husband:</strong> Receives 1/2 if the deceased has no children, and 1/4 if she has

                        <li><strong>Wife:</strong> Receives 1/4 if the deceased has no children, and 1/8 if he has
                            children.</li>
                        <li><strong>Son:</strong> Receives a double share compared to a daughter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Daughter:</strong> A single daughter receives 1/2. Two or more daughters
                            collectively receive 2/3.</li>
                        <li><strong>Father:</strong> Receives 1/6 if the deceased has children.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mother:</strong> Receives 1/6 if the deceased has children, and 1/3 if there are no

                        <h3>What is the importance of a Will (Wasiyyah) in Islam?</h3>
                        <p>A Will, or Wasiyyah, is a legal document that allows a Muslim to bequeath up to one-third of
                            their wealth to non-heirs. The remaining two-thirds of the estate must be distributed among
                            the prescribed heirs according to Islamic law. A Will is highly recommended in Islam to
                            ensure that one's wishes are fulfilled after death.</p>

                        <p>Yes, besides the primary heirs, other relatives such as grandparents, grandchildren, and
                            siblings may also be entitled to a share of the inheritance, depending on the specific
                            circumstances of the deceased's family. This calculator focuses on the most common
                            scenarios, and for more complex cases, it is advisable to consult a scholar.</p>
